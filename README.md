### Hello, I am Finnex!

I'm currently exploring frameworks, and libraries that are interesting (for me, at least). Finding fun, and time-saving stuff is really beneficial. 
In my journey of finding great things I found: ``SvelteKit`` and ``shadcn-ui``. Both are awesome stuff, you should try them out too!
